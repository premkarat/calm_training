    "Before we understand the journey from an object code to process, it is important to understand how CPU works \n",
    "\n",
    "## How CPU works?\n",
    "\n",
    "The CPU is a simple device that does only 3 things (in that order). The process of doing these 3 things is called <font color=\"royalblue\">instruction cycle</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. <font color=\"royalblue\"> Fetch</font> Instruction  (from Random Access Memory, a.k.a RAM)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. <font color=\"red\">Decode</font> Instruction (using Control Unit)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. <font color=\"green\">Execute</font> Instruction (using ALU, FPU etc..)\n",
    "\n",
    "The time taken by an instruction cycle is measured in [clock ticks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_signal)\n",
    "\n",
    "So in a <font color=\"royalblue\">1 GHz processor</font> there are <font color=\"red\">1 billion clock ticks/second</font> in which <font color=\"green\">N instruction cycles/second </font> gets executed. <font color=\"green\">N</font> depends on CPU architecture and time complextity of the CPU instruction. \n",
    "\n",
    "The faster the clock ticks, the faster is the CPU execution but the downfall is, clock speed is detrimental to power consumption (data center cooling etc...), which is a major concern in datacenters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fetch\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of Random Access Memory (RAM) as a big static array (in programming sense). So as in any array, it has an index and data. The index is referred to as <font color=\"royalblue\">Virtual Address (32 or 64 bit long depending on CPU)</font> and data is the information stored in that address. \n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=\"darkorange\">What information is stored in a Virtual Address?</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Well it could be one of the following (in simple sense)\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. <font color=\"royalblue\">CPU Instruction</font> with Operands\n",
    " \n",
    " 2. <font color=\"red\">Virtual Address</font> of a device or another location in RAM\n",
    " \n",
    " 3. <font color=\"green\">Data</font> (Constants, Globals and variables used in functions)\n",
    "\n",
    "CPU always fetches the instruction from RAM. But which location/address in RAM?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is, <font color=\"royalblue\">Program Counter (PC)</font>. PC stores the Virtual address (VA) of the instruction. Every CPU architecture has specific name for the program counter. For Intel CPUs it is <font color=\"royalblue\">Instruction Address Register (IAR)</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=\"darkorange\">But how does the Program Counter get the virtual address?</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Well it could be one of the following\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. During a <font color=\"royalblue\">context switch</font> (covered later), PC gets initialized with a VA provided by Linux Kernel. <font color=\"red\">(OR)</font>\n",
    "    \n",
    "  2. <font color=\"red\">JMP</font> (jump caused by <font color=\"royalblue\">branching (if/else,...), looping (for, while..))</font> CPU instruction causes PC to be updated with new address. <font color=\"red\">(OR)</font>\n",
    "    \n",
    "  3. PC <font color=\"green\">auto increments</font> to next address, if 1) or 2) doesn't happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decode\n",
    "\n",
    "The decoding is done by the <font color=\"royalblue\">CPU Control Unit</font>. Decoding essentially does 2 things. Decode the CPU instruction to figure out\n",
    "\n",
    "1. <font color=\"royalblue\">What operation</font> needs to be performed?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Pass control to the <font color=\"green\">operation handler</font> depending on the operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The operation could be an (not limited to below 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. arthmetic operation, so invoke ALU, (or)\n",
    "    2. floating point operation so invoke FPU (or)\n",
    "    3. Memory operation so read/write memory\n",
    "    4. IO operation so invoke IO controller\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Execute\n",
    "\n",
    "Control signals are send from the Control Unit to the operation handler and appropriate <font color=\"royalblue\"> registers</font> are setup so that the operation handler can now execute the operation. The actual job gets done here.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Demonstration of how CPU works**\n",
    "\n",
    "Task for the CPU is to add two numbers 2 and 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. The instructions for the CPU are stored from VA 0 to 3.\n",
    "    2. The data values 2 & 3 are stored in VA 500 & 501.\n",
    "    3. Registers R1, R2 & R3 are used for loading & saving the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/cpu_execution.gif\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The <font color=\"red\">key take away</font> from knowing \"How CPU works?\" is 2 key things. \n",
    "\n",
    " 1. PC, mostly <font color=\"royalblue\">auto increments</font> itself, to fetch next address until <font color=\"red\">context switch</font> or a <font color=\"red\">JMP</font> happens\n",
    " \n",
    " 2. Because of 1), <font color=\"royalblue\">CPU instructions</font> in RAM needs to be <font color=\"green\">contiguous</font>. \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " Before we understand what is conext switch and why it happens, lets focus on 2). \n",
    " \n",
    " <font color=\"darkorange\">How to ensure CPU instructios are contiguous in RAM?</font>\n",
    "\n",
