    "Before we understand the journey from an object code to process, it is important to understand how CPU works \n",
    "\n",
    "## How CPU works?\n",
    "\n",
    "The CPU is a simple device that does only 3 things (in that order). The process of doing these 3 things is called <font color=\"royalblue\">instruction cycle</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. <font color=\"royalblue\"> Fetch</font> Instruction  (from Random Access Memory, a.k.a RAM)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. <font color=\"red\">Decode</font> Instruction (using Control Unit)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. <font color=\"green\">Execute</font> Instruction (using ALU, FPU etc..)\n",
    "\n",
    "The time taken by an instruction cycle is measured in [clock ticks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_signal)\n",
    "\n",
    "So in a <font color=\"royalblue\">1 GHz processor</font> there are <font color=\"red\">1 billion clock ticks/second</font> in which <font color=\"green\">X instruction cycles/second </font> gets executed. X depends on CPU architecture and time complextity of the CPU instruction. \n",
    "\n",
    "The faster the clock ticks, the faster is the CPU execution but the downfall is, clock speed is detrimental to power consumption (DC cooling etc....), which is a major concern in datacenters.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fetch\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of Random Access Memory (RAM) as a big static array (in programming sense). So as in any array, it has an index and data. The index is referred to as <font color=\"royalblue\">Virtual Address (32 or 64 bit long depending on CPU)</font> and data is the information stored in that address. \n",
    "\n",
    "What data is stored in a Virtual Address? Well it could be one of the following (in simple sense)\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. <font color=\"royalblue\">CPU Instruction</font> with Operands\n",
    " \n",
    " 2. <font color=\"red\">Virtual Address</font> of a device or another location of RAM\n",
    " \n",
    " 3. <font color=\"green\">Data</font> (Constants, Globals and variables used in functions)\n",
    "\n",
    "CPU always fetches the instruction from RAM. But which location/address in RAM?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is, <font color=\"royalblue\">Program Counter (PC)</font>. PC stores the Virtual address (VA) of the instruction. Every CPU architecture has specific name for the program counter. For Intel CPUs it is <font color=\"royalblue\">Instruction Address Register (IAR)</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "But how does the Program Counter get the virtual address?\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. During a <font color=\"royalblue\">context switch</font>, PC gets initialized with a VA provided by Linux Kernel.\n",
    "    \n",
    "  2. <font color=\"red\">JMP</font> (jump) CPU instruction causes PC to be updated with new address\n",
    "    \n",
    "  3. PC <font color=\"green\">auto increments</font> to next address, if 1) or 2) doesn't happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "The important takeaway is PC mostly auto increments itself to fetch next address until <font color=\"red\">context switch</font> (more on that later) happens, so instructions in RAM needs to be <font color=\"royalblue\">contiguous</font>. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decode\n",
    "\n",
    "The decoding is done by the <font color=\"royalblue\">CPU Control Unit</font>. Decoding essentially does 2 things. Decode the CPU instruction to figure out\n",
    "\n",
    "1. <font color=\"royalblue\">What operation</font> needs to be performed?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Pass control to the <font color=\"green\">operation handler</font> depending on the operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The operation could be an (not limited to below 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. arthmetic operation, so invoke ALU, (or)\n",
    "    2. floating point operation so invoke FPU (or)\n",
    "    3. Memory operation so read memory\n",
    "    4. IO operation so invoke IO controller\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Execute\n",
    "\n",
    "Control signals are send from the Control Unit to the operation handler and appropriate <font color=\"royalblue\"> registers</font> are setup so that the operation handler can now execute the operation. The actual job gets done here.\n",
